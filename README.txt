Developed a robust speech digit recognition system that utilizes Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The system was trained on a dataset of digit utterances using MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) for feature extraction, capturing critical aspects of the audio signals. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set, preserving over 80% of the original variance. The HMM-GMM model achieved a test accuracy of 95%, while the RNN was optimized using techniques such as Adam optimizer, L2 regularization, and early stopping, leading to stable and efficient training. The system's performance was evaluated using confusion matrices and other metrics, demonstrating its ability to accurately classify spoken digits, even in noisy environments.
